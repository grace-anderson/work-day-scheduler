# Code Quiz Challenge

## Purpose
This app is a simple daily planner application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. 

[Deployed calendar app](https://grace-anderson.github.io/work-day-scheduler/)

## Features and Technology

The work day scheduler app runs in the browser using dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) is used to work with date and time. Local storage saves entered events. The day and date displayed in the header updates for each day.

The hour time blocks update according to the current hour. Past hours are greyed out, the current hour is coloured red, and future hours are coloured green

The application code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/grace-anderson/work-day-scheduler). 

## Usage
Users, such as employees with a busy schedule, can add important events to the workday scheduler and so manage their work time time effectively. 

The header day and date update daily, and the user can click on each hour of the work day to add, update or remove events in that hour. Each activity can be saved separately using the button at the right hand side of each hour block. 

The user can observe the progress of time during the day using the changes in hour block colour, with the current hour highlighted red and future hours coloured green. Past hours are greyed-out.

Saved events will continue to display after the user refreshes or reopens the app. Events saved are retained unless removed or updated, so that the user can schedule in recurring events that repeat daily.
